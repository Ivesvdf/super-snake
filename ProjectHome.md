A high-performance, small-size Snake clone.
Uses curses for its visualisation. It only needs a 80x24 ISO compliant console for output and a keyboard with arrow keys for input.

It runs on pretty much every computer, even REALLY slow ones. If your calculator is POSIX compliant, it can probably run on that. It only uses 0.3% CPU on my Single Core 2Ghz Virtual PC.
